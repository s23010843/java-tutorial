# 18) Next Steps: Projects to Build

Pick one and build it end-to-end.

## Beginner projects

1. CLI calculator (parse args, handle errors)
2. To-do list (file persistence)
3. Word counter (maps, sorting)

## Intermediate projects

1. Simple HTTP client (call a public API, parse JSON)
2. Mini library system (OOP + collections)
3. Concurrency downloader (executors + futures)

## Advanced projects

1. Build a small REST API (Spring Boot)
2. Write a small Java library with tests and a published artifact
3. Performance profiling exercise (JFR / async-profiler)

## Suggested learning order from here

- Solidify collections, streams, and testing
- Learn Maven/Gradle
- Build 2–3 projects and deploy something
